### COCKTAILS - DA project-2


## Introduction

This project wants to show variety of cocktails and some date related as nutritional facts

Working on different technics to gathering data:

1. Research of datasets of cocktails: IBA official list as base
2. Research dedicated websites for scrapping

Unfortunately, my research wasn't good and I lost a lot of time changing focus of this project.

## Data cleaning

Cleaning source dataset comming from Kraggle

1. Cleaning of null elements, either eliminated or replaced by "Unknown, so that the necessary filter is applied to obtain the necessary data.
2. Adjust columns names and types

## Transformation

1. Added new data from web scrapping of top guide of cocktails (https://www.diffordsguide.com)
2. Nutritional data , Garnish updated and link to web card added

## Hypothesis

1. Which categories we have for cocktails and how are distributed.
2. To know how many calories has every cocktail: max and minimum
3. How calories are distributed? Similar values?

## Conclusions

1.Cocktails use to have a medium number of calories but some of them have a relevant number of calories., similar to eat a chicken grilled piece...

2. There are many cocktails around the world but there is an official list published by IBA (International Bartenders Association). Cocktails are grouped in a similar way across different categories.

3. About how to serve cocktails, type of glass is specified: Coupe Glass and Old-Fashioned glass are most usual ones.
